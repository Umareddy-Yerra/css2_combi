        On the Insert tab, the galleries include items 
        that are designed to coordinate with the overall look of 
        your document. You can use these galleries to insert tables,
         headers, footers, lists, cover pages, and other document building
         blocks. When you create pictures, charts, or diagrams, they also coordinate
          with your current document look. You can easily change the formatting of selected
           text in the document text by choosing a look for the selected text from the Quick
            Styles gallery on the Home tab. You can also format text directly by using the other
             controls on the Home tab. Most controls offer a choice of using the look from the 
             current theme or using a format that you specify directly. To change the overall
              look of your document, choose new Theme elements on the Page Layout tab. To change 
              the looks available in the Quick Style gallery, use the Change Current Quick Style 
              Set command. Both the Themes gallery and the Quick Styles gallery provide reset commands
               so that you can always restore the look of your document to the original contained in
                your current template. On the Insert tab, the galleries include items that are designed
                to coordinate with the overall look of your document. You can use these galleries to 
                insert tables, headers, footers, lists, cover pages, and other document building blocks.

                 document look.
